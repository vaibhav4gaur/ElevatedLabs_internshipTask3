## **🧑🏻‍🏫 This is based on dataset to train model and predict accurate insights data values , which is implements and understanding simple and multiple regression** 
---
## **🛠 There tools used in scikit-learn , Pandas , Matplotlib**
## **📌 Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn) is a free and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language. It provides a wide range of tools for various machine learning tasks**

- ### **✅ Import and preprocess the dataset, Split data into train-test sets.**
